                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                
                While modern mental health treatment has progressed into more evidence-based practices, the influence of ancient traditions persists, offering insight into holistic well-being, the connection between mind and body, and the importance of cultural context in healing. A culturally informed approach, as Dr. Jessica Dere suggests, highlights that effective treatment must consider the cultural narratives and values of individuals, just as ancient societies intertwined mental health with their spiritual and communal beliefs. By integrating these historical insights, modern practitioners can craft more empathetic and effective strategies, recognizing that mental wellness is not only a medical endeavor but also a cultural and human one.<br/><br/>

                <h3>Synthesizing Analysis</h3>
                While modern mental health treatment has progressed into more evidence-based practices, the influence of ancient traditions persists, offering insight into holistic well- Despite significant cultural differences, various ancient civilizations gradually evolved their understanding of mental illness from supernatural to more rational perspectives. However, over time, all of these cultures showed a trend towards a more systematic and empirical approach to understanding and treating mental health, which ultimately laid the foundation for modern medicine. As Roy Porter, a well-known medical historian notes, the evolution of mental health understanding across these civilizations reveals a gradual departure from purely supernatural explanations towards approaches that integrated empirical observation and rational thinking. (Porter, 2022) while Mesopotamian and Egyptian approaches remained heavily reliant on religious and spiritual interpretations, there were emerging elements of physiological understanding that pointed towards more empirical approaches. Ancient Greece and China made more explicit strides in this direction, emphasizing bodily balance, lifestyle, and rationality as the key to mental health. At the same time, various civilizations have adopted drug therapy as one of the main therapies for treating mental illnesses through experience summarization, such as the developed herbal medicine in ancient Egypt and traditional Chinese medicine in ancient China. This laid the foundation for pharmacological treatment of psychological disorders in the future.<br/>
                <br/>

                Whatâ€™s more, Smith, a historian specializing in cultural influences on medicine, explores how ancient practices, including Chinese qigong and Greek dialogue therapy, continue to influence modern approaches to mental wellness. Smith highlights how practices such as meditation, herbal remedies, and talk therapies have roots in ancient traditions in National Geographic. (Smith 2022) Due to the influence of historical continuity, each culture has unique methods of treating mental illness that have been passed down through generations, with distinctive effectiveness and varying degrees of spread within the population. These traditional practices are deeply embedded in cultural narratives and collective experiences, which not only influence their acceptance but also enhance their perceived efficacy. Practices such as qigong, meditation, and acupuncture have remained integral to Chinese society for centuries. these practices continue to influence modern wellness routines, as they are seen not only as medical interventions but also as pathways to inner harmony and balance. Chinese medicine emphasizes a holistic view of the body, linking mental well-being with physiological balance, and this perspective resonates deeply with cultural values surrounding harmony and the natural world. In conclusion, the unique effectiveness and spread of traditional mental health treatments in different cultures are deeply rooted in historical continuity and cultural significance, which are also regarded as their cultural heritage and treasures.<br/>
                <br/>
                Dr. Jessica Dere, a clinical psychologist with expertise in cross-cultural psychology, in her TEDx talk(You can watch the talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrYmQDiunSc" target="_blank">here</a>), "Challenges and Rewards of a Culturally-Informed Approach to Mental Health," introduces the critical concept that effective mental health treatment must be culturally informed. This perspective emphasizes the importance of understanding patients' cultural backgrounds to design treatment plans that resonate deeply with them.( Jessica 2019) I fully agree with this point, and I believe it is a trend in the future treatment of mental illness, or a point that all treatment plans should pay attention to. For example, the treatment of Chinese and Americans should be different according to different cultures. The former is more likely to accept the involvement of family members in the treatment, because under the influence of Confucianism, Chinese people pay more attention to family values. The latter should choose behavioral cognitive therapy (CBT) that is more inclined towards individualism. For ethnic groups with religious beliefs, introducing appropriate religious doctrines may be more helpful.
