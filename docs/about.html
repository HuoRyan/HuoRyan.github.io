          <p>orientation paragraph: In this section, I will first present the content of my first part, Strategic Reflection. The content of this task not only gave me a deeper understanding of myself, but also inspired me to approach the comparison and research of different cultures from different perspectives. Afterwards, I will present my planning research section, which includes my ideas and framework for the research.</p>
	    <p>In Strategic Reflection, I exploring how it has shaped my beliefs, traditions, values, and way of interacting with others. I examine several key aspects, including religion, festivals, food, and communication styles, to demonstrate how deeply rooted cultural influences have shaped my personality and worldview.

        Religious Beliefs: Although I identify as non-religious due to my parents' Communist and scientific upbringing, I acknowledge the pervasive influence of Buddhism and Taoism in Chinese culture. This includes practices like wearing jade for protection, visiting temples, and following traditions such as praying to Manjusri Bodhisattva before exams or considering feng shui during games. These elements, while not tied to strict faith, are ingrained in my daily life and cultural identity.
        
        Festivals and Customs: Traditional Chinese festivals like the Spring Festival, Qingming Festival, and Mid-Autumn Festival play a central role in shaping my familial bonds and sense of clan identity. Customs such as eating dumplings, honoring ancestors, and celebrating with family emphasize filial piety, respect for elders, and the importance of unity. These traditions have instilled values of politeness and respect within me.
        
        Cuisine: I highlight my preference for stir-fried dishes and spicy food as part of my cultural upbringing. I also observe regional differences in Chinese cuisine, such as the sweet dishes in Shanghai, which reflect the diversity within the country itself.
        
        Communication Style: Influenced by Confucian principles, I adopt a humble and indirect way of speaking, emphasizing politeness and avoiding confrontation. I attribute this to the hierarchical and harmonious ideals promoted by Confucianism and absorbed through family teachings and literary works. </p>

                <h3>Planning research</h3>
                <p>When planning and preparing for my research, I started by reflecting on my academic interests and the broader implications of understanding mental illness through a historical lens. The decision to explore ancient explanations and treatments for mental illness arose from my fascination with how different cultures shaped their understanding of mental health based on their philosophical, spiritual, and medical frameworks. I aimed to investigate how these historical perspectives influenced modern mental health practices and cultural attitudes.

                To narrow my focus, I selected four regions—Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, and China—because of their significant contributions to early medicine and philosophy. These regions provided rich and diverse examples of how ancient civilizations approached mental illness from both supernatural and rational perspectives. My selection process involved reviewing primary and secondary sources to identify civilizations with substantial documentation of medical and cultural practices related to mental health. Each region offered a unique lens through which to examine the interplay of cultural beliefs, medical theories, and treatment methods.</p>
