By examining the perspectives of Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, and China, the discussion highlights how these societies attributed mental disturbances to spiritual, emotional, or physiological causes, and developed treatments aligned with their unique worldviews. Through rituals, philosophical theories, and holistic practices, these ancient approaches not only provide insight into early medical thought but also lay the groundwork for contemporary mental health practices.</p>

          <p align="justify"><a href="#"><img src="images/templatemo_image_07.jpg" alt="image" class="image_frame image_fl" /></a> Ancient Chinese medical thought posited that an imbalance in yin and yang could lead to illnesses, including mental disorders. The theory of yin and yang, combined with the Five Elements theory, was used to explain the physiological and psychological workings and pathological mechanisms of the body. For example, the Huangdi Neijing (Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon), one of the earliest TCM classics discussing mental health, pointed out that excessive emotions such as anger, joy, worry, sadness, and fear could disrupt the internal organs, leading to mental disorders (Unschuld, 2011). The Five Elements (Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water) were used to describe relationships among internal organs and how emotions correspond to these elements. In treating mental illness, ancient China employed many unique methods, combining herbal medicine, acupuncture, herbal therapy, qigong, and psychological therapies. Daoist philosophy emphasized inner peace and harmony with nature, and qigong and meditation were used as means of emotional regulation. Practicing qigong helped control breathing and enhance the flow of qi within the body, promoting relaxation. Meditation was used to clear the mind of distractions, allowing patients to achieve a state of inner tranquility, thereby alleviating mental suffering (Kohn, 2008). </p>

        	<h3><a href="#">Ancient Egypt</a></h3>
        	<p align="justify"><a href="#"><img src="images/templatemo_image_05.jpg" alt="image" class="image_frame image_fl" /></a>  The Egyptians viewed health, including mental health, as a balance between different aspects of the body and soul. The heart was seen as the center of thought, emotion, and memory, and therefore critical to mental health (Nunn, 2002). Mental disturbances were sometimes linked to physical conditions, but they were also often attributed to spiritual imbalance or the influence of malevolent forces. Similar to Mesopotamia, Egyptian healers utilized prayers, invocations, and rituals to appeal to the gods for healing. Priests played a crucial role, as they were seen as intermediaries between the divine and the human realms. Patients were encouraged to sleep in the temple, where they might receive healing dreams or visions from the gods, providing both physical and psychological comfort (Ghalioungui, 1973). </p>

                <h3><a href="#">Ancient Greece</a></h3>
                <p align="justify"><a href="#"><img src="images/templatemo_image_06.jpg" alt="image" class="image_frame image_fl" /></a>  In ancient Greece, the understanding and treatment of mental illness were heavily influenced by philosophical and medical thought. The most well-known Greek physician, Hippocrates, introduced the "Humoral Theory," which posited that the body was composed of four humors (blood, yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm), and that an imbalance in these humors could lead to mental disorders. For example, an excess of black bile was associated with "melancholia" (which corresponds to what we call depression today) (Jackson, 2013). Hippocrates attributed mental illness to internal bodily causes rather than divine punishment or curses, thus pioneering a rational approach to medicine. Besides, Aristotle further explored mental health from psychological and moral perspectives, suggesting that mental disorders could arise from disturbances in emotions and rational thought. He believed that unchecked desires and emotions could lead to psychological issues (Nussbaum, 1994). The common treatment methods at that time were healthy diet, adequate sleep, and regular exercise to maintain humoral balance. At the same time, certain plants, such as poppy and mandrake, were used to alleviate mental stress and anxiety. The Greeks also paid attention to emotional and psychological regulation, using methods such as dialogue (similar to modern talk therapy) and drama therapy to help patients express emotions and relieve inner stress. (Jones, 2005). </p>

            <h3><a href="#">Ancient Mesopotamia</a></h3>
       	  <p align="justify"><a href="#"><img src="images/templatemo_image_04.jpg" alt="image" class="image_frame image_fl" /></a> In ancient Mesopotamia, mental illness was often perceived as a consequence of divine wrath or demonic possession. For instance, emotional disturbances like intense anxiety or hallucinations were believed to indicate that a person was cursed or possessed by demons. The Mesopotamians attributed these conditions to spiritual causes, which required spiritual remedies (Reed, 2017). Mesopotamian healers, often priests, performed rituals to expel evil spirits by using incantations, prayers, and symbolic acts, such as the use of amulets or figurines. (Lambert, 1998). </p>
